# How the skills work together

This is the routing used by the original design setup, with project-specific libraries replaced by skills that query the destination file. **A track is a sequence, not a single skill.** The six external skills in the sequences are listed in [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md) and installed from their authors' files.

## Choose the stage first

Load `explore-vs-final` when the work may produce rejected options or a selected design for handoff. Exploration can use direct positioning and local values; a final direction needs durable layout, appropriate tokens, components, and complete states. This choice sits across both Figma tracks.

Before a Figma write, apply `figma-workflow`: pin the file key and expected name, save a restore point, and verify the target after each write. Read the relevant product brief and design rules. For a **full track build**, read the complete `references/` directories of every skill in that track before building. The main `SKILL.md` files are summaries; their references do not load automatically. Also search real app screens with Mobbin MCP before choosing an open pattern. References provide principles; real screens provide visual evidence. The original setup requires both. Mobbin is a separate MCP, so a new project must connect it or explicitly record that this evidence step could not run. An isolated correction can load only the relevant references.

## Wireframe track

```text
ux-designer (Yummy Labs)
  → project brief and screen specs
  → figma-wireframe-kit (this repo; generic adaptation)
  → ux-copywriter (Yummy Labs)
  → build and review grayscale flow
```

Use this track for flows, information structure, and low-fidelity screens. `ui-designer` is **not** part of this track. A wireframe kit may supply components; if it is unavailable, use consistent grayscale primitives. Do not copy component keys from another Figma file.

If writing through Figma Console MCP, also load `figma-console-api` from Yummy Labs before writing Plugin API code. A settled brief can be executed by `wireframe-builder` in a new section. That agent has no Mobbin tool, so resolve open pattern decisions in the main session before handing it the brief. For a review, use `figma-auditor` instead.

## Production UI track

```text
ux-designer (Yummy Labs)
  → project brief and approved flow
  → figma-design-system-ui (this repo; generic adaptation)
  → ui-designer (Yummy Labs)
  → ux-copywriter (Yummy Labs)
  → short build plan and designer review
  → build, inspect pixels, verify bindings and states
```

Use this track for a selected visual direction and handoff-ready screens. `ui-designer` is the added visual-craft step that distinguishes it from the wireframe track. Query the actual destination library for components, variable modes, and token values. Treat the shared library as read-only unless the user explicitly requests library work. Load `figma-console-api` before writing Figma Plugin API code.

The `ui-designer` build plan answers five questions: (1) which existing components will be reused, with exact references; (2) which new components are needed and why; (3) which interaction and data states each component needs; (4) what the screen → region → component hierarchy is; and (5) which empty, failure, permission, length, and localization edge cases matter. Present one component table, one hierarchy tree, and one edge-case list for designer review before a substantial canvas build. Track decisions that arise during the build. For a narrow fix to an already approved screen, load only the skills relevant to that fix.

## Motion is an overlay

Figma prototype motion is not a third design track. It runs on frames from either track: load `figma-prototype-motion` and `figma-console-api` before editing reactions or keyframes. Verify matching layer paths, reaction destinations, timeout values, and timing. Figma MCP cannot play Present mode, so the designer must judge the feel in Figma.

For a coded React prototype, use Yummy Labs' `interactive-prototype` instead of the Figma motion workflow. That skill is distributed by its author.

## Port, copy, and content

- **Port an approved feature:** `figma-clone-port` → `figma-design-system-ui` for the destination. Add `figma-prototype-motion` if the source includes reaction chains. Inspect source and destination files in separate pinned runs.
- **Set voice across the product:** `voice-tone-builder`; then use `ux-copywriter` for specific interface strings. `copy-reviewer` can audit a batch without editing files or Figma.
- **Long-form research writing:** ComposioHQ's `content-research-writer`, outside the Figma tracks.
- **Satirical idea exploration:** `theboxexplore` only when invoked by name, outside ordinary UX planning.
- **Publish an approved spec:** `gitbook-porter` creates and verifies a change request, then stops before merge.

## Rules and agents

The original setup had four root rules, adapted here as [`figma-workflow`](rules/figma-workflow.md), [`explore-vs-final`](rules/explore-vs-final.md), [`model-selection`](rules/model-selection.md), and [`writing-style`](rules/writing-style.md). Project-specific rules and product specs stayed in the private project. This public repo adds [`design-tracks`](rules/design-tracks.md) so a new project can route requests through the sequences above.

The four agents are optional, explicitly invoked tools: `copy-reviewer` and `figma-auditor` only read, `wireframe-builder` writes only to a new section, and `gitbook-porter` prepares a reviewable change request. Give them the exact product and source files because they start without the main conversation's context. Production UI and motion stay in the main design session, where the designer can judge the canvas.
